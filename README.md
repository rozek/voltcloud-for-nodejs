# voltcloud-for-nodejs #

a simple VoltCloud client library for Node.js

[VoltCloud.io](https://voltcloud.io) is a simple (and reasonably priced) deployment server for web applications with integrated user management and key-value stores for both the application itself and any of its users.

`voltcloud-for-nodejs` is a simple client library for applications (or servers) based on Node.js which need access to VoltCloud and its functions.

See below for a "smoke test" which may also serve as an example for how to use this library.

**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/voltcloud-for-nodejs/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)

> Just a small note: if you like this module and plan to use it, consider "starring" this repository (you will find the "Star" button on the top right of this page), so that I know which of my repositories to take most care of.
