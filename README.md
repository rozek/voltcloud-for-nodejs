# voltcloud-for-nodejs #

a simple VoltCloud client library for Node.js

[VoltCloud.io](https://voltcloud.io) is a simple (and reasonably priced) deployment server for web applications with integrated user management and key-value stores for both the application itself and any of its users.

`voltcloud-for-nodejs` is a simple client library for applications (or servers) based on Node.js which need access to VoltCloud and its functions.

See below for a "smoke test" which may also serve as an example for how to use this library.

**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/voltcloud-for-nodejs/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)

## Overview ##

As a developer, one may sign-up for VoltCloud to create (web-based) applications and give them a name. Then, the actual application may be uploaded to VoltCloud and will from now on be served from a VoltCloud URL which includes the given name.

If desired, VoltCloud applications may support their own "users" (in this document, these users are called "customers" in order to explicitly distinguish them from application "developers").

Users may register themselves for a VoltCloud application by providing their EMail address (which also serves as a "user name") and a password (which they will need to log into the application). Upon registration, a "confirmation mail" will be sent to the given address that includes a special link to the application which, when clicked, will allow the application to confirm the given user. Should the confirmation message get lost, it may be resent upon request.

Should a customer forget his/ger password, there is also the possibility to initiate a "password reset" process. If triggered, a "password reset email" with a special link to the application will be sent to the customer which, when clicked, should allow the customer to change his/her password. A password reset may be triggered as often as needed.
